# Resistance2
Rework of Arma 3 Resistance mission that we enjoyed playing back in the A3 beta days. Bringing it up to date with all the new technologies we have access to since that time.

Starting as a guerilla force with limited access to resources work together to liberate your homeland from a superior force and build up your power over time.

# Main Features Planned
- Persistent mission that can be run on a public server.
- DAC3 Powered AI.
- ACE3 Integration.
- ACRE2 Radio Integration.
- Designed for use both with and without a headless client.
- Zone rewards that improve as the mission progresses over time.
